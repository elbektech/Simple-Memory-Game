## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
* Overall, the process was not so hard but I was a little confused to set up correctly a glitch project because my glitch settings were different than the given instructions. Although, it took me some time to get used to the glitch configurations, I was able to overcome by following instructions and by playing around in Glitch IDE. Another challenge, I had to overcome was building the game interface in HTML, since I used a default index.html, I had to figure out what does each line performs because it helped me to know whether some portions of code to delete or save.

2. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
* Do these three programming languages (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) are good enough to learn to become an expert web developer?

3. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
* If I had more chance to spend on this project, I would add additional features like adding a timer that allows a user to repeat each pattern in a given time, for example from level 1 to 4 user can be given 10-15 seconds to guess. Another interesting feature, I could add to the game is offering a chance to earn points to the user for each correct guess in a pattern; Points can be deducted from the user if a user enters a wrong guess.
